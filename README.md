Iora is a boilerplate stuffed into a CLI tool that makes it a breeze to create modular servers through Express.

You can route requests to JavaScript files and add middleware that's either npm or locally hosted via `iora.json`

Check out [iora-static](https://github.com/iora/iora-static) middleware if you're interested in making a portion of your server a static file-serve.

# Install
You can install iora via npm:

```
npm install -g iora
```
(May require `sudo`)

# Usage
```
iora <command> [directory] [options...]
```

Run `iora help` for a list of commands and their usage.

# Documentation
Iora is documented here on GitHub through the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/iora/iora/wiki), you can find a lot of information from the community there.  But, you can also find official documentation at www.iorajs.org/docs/
